## GGJ Theme: Masks

**Our Interpretation:**
In *Midnight Masquerade*, we interpreted the theme through the duality of social classes. The "Mask" is not just a physical object but a mechanical key that dictates how the world perceives and reacts to the player. We focused on the tension between being "seen" and being "recognized."

This project was designed, prototyped, and polished within **48 hours**. Our goal was to create a cohesive stealth loop using a minimalist "Noir" aesthetic and a robust Finite State Machine for AI.

**"Identity is your greatest disguise."**
Midnight Masquerade is a top-down stealth-infiltration game developed for **Global Game Jam 2026**. Players take on the role of a master infiltrator who must navigate through high-society galas, servant quarters, and hedge mazes by strategically switching masks to blend into different social classes.

## Core Gameplay & Objectives

The ultimate goal is to infiltrate the estate and retrieve **three hidden artifacts**, one from each high-security zone, and reach the extraction point undetected.

* **Heist Objective:** Locate and collect the 3 Unique Artifacts (Noble Crest, Servant’s Ledger, and The Golden Rose).
* **Identity Management:** Use the **Crimson (Noble)**, **Azure (Servant)**, or **Emerald (Gardener)** masks to access restricted zones. Swapping masks is only possible in "Safe Zones" (out of guard sight).
* **Stealth-First Infiltration:** There is no combat. Success depends on timing, line-of-sight manipulation, and environment awareness.
* **Dynamic Detection:** Suspicion levels rise based on your current mask and proximity to guards. A 100% suspicion level results in an instant capture.

## Visual Direction (Noir Aesthetic)

* **Art Style:** High-contrast Pixel Art.
* **Color Theory:** Low-saturation environments (Inky Blue, Anthracite) to make functional colors (Identity Masks) pop.
* **Lighting:** Heavy use of shadows and light cones to enhance the "Noir" atmosphere.

## Technical Stack

* **Engine:** 
* **Architecture:** 
* **Version Control:** Git-flow for collaborative development.

* **Adal:** Project Architect & Lead Artist (Environment, Sprites, Lighting)
